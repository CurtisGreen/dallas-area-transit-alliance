On Thursday, April 24th, 2025, DART Board Members, elected mayors, Amalgamated Transit Union members, and DATA Citizen Advocates descended upon the Texas Capitol to protect DART's full 1% sales tax funding. Advocates arrived at the Capitol early in the morning around 8am, when the Transportation Committee was first scheduled to meet, but it would be nearly 14 hours before the committee would finally get to the bill they were there to oppose.
