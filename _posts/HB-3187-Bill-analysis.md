It finally happened, The legislation that Plano has been threatening they would be pursuing has finally been filed. 

# NERD WORDS AHEAD

The following article can be pretty wonky, if you're into municipal finance and public administration you’ll be right at home but here’s the TL;DR for everyone else. This bill is bad, it diverts 25% of DARTs revenue so that it can only be used for Road and sidewalk maintenance, and then it sets up additional restrictions to eventually force DART to lower its tax rate from 1% to .75%. That’s a 44% reduction after everything is implemented. it would definitely destroy the ability of DART to maintain its current operations, let alone improve service. This bill will put DART on life support, throwing away all of the hard work DART is doing to improve and tailor their services to the cities, all without holding an election for the citizens of the service area decided that this is what they want.

## Background - What is a bond?

A bond is like a little piece of a loan, we a governmental entity like DART has a big project they want to build (like say a 27-mile suburban commuter rail line) they probably don’t have the cash on hand to pay for it all at once. They need to get a loan to spread out the cost because it would take a LONG time to save up all the money needed.

Fig. 1 \- This is an overly simplistic example, in reality the bond holder might only get interest payment monthly or quarterly, or just a large lump sum at when the bond reaches maturity. Those details are not important for this discussion.

DART issues a particular type of bond called a Sales Tax Revenue Bonds. Instead of putting up a piece of collateral (like you would with a mortgage) these bonds are secured by future sales tax revenues   

Underlying each bond is an agreement, a contract. This contract lays out the nitty gritty details on how interest is calculated, how the administrative cost of the bonds are paid for, when are payments made, what happens if DART should default, the process for appointing a representative of the bound holders, and much more. If you’re curious you can try and wade through the [entire 66 page document](https://www.dartbonds.org/dart-investor-relations-tx/documents/view-file/i1016?mediaId=32701), but it's pretty dry, and probably won’t make much sense unless you're a lawyer or banker.  
There is one section that is important to know (thank you to David Leininger, former CFO of DART for bringing this to the public's attention in a [post on linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/plano-v-dart-dilemma-pullout-one-city-versus-pulldown-david-leininger-fmooc/))

>Section 2.2
	(b) For so long as any Obligations are Outstanding or unpaid, or any Administrative Expenses are due, payable, and unpaid, DART covenants and agrees that (i) the Sales Tax at said rate, or at a higher rate if permitted by Applicable Law and subject to any applicable requirements for an election under the Voted Tax and Debt Limits, will be levied and collected continuously, in the manner and to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law; and (ii) the Board will not order any reduction in the rate of tax below the rate stated, confirmed and ordered in subsection (a) of this Section.

Basically what this saying is, as long as there is an outstanding bond, DART will not lower its tax rate. Another important fact to know is this section of the Texas Constitution (emphasis added)
> Article 1. Bill of Rights:
> Sec. 16.  BILLS OF ATTAINDER; EX POST FACTO OR RETROACTIVE LAWS; IMPAIRING OBLIGATION OF CONTRACTS.  
> **No** bill of attainder, ex post facto law, retroactive law, or any **law impairing the obligation of contracts, shall be made.**

Together this means the State can't come in and pass a law forcing DART to lower its tax rate when it has already obligated its self to maintain that tax rate for its bondholders.

# How to read a bill

Legislation is hard to read\! This ain't your mothers 3rd grade english class. The law is complicated, full of jargon, terms of art, big concepts, and bills are written to only show the changes they are making, so you can lose a lot of context of what's in the rest of the legal code.

Here’s a decent video that goes through some of the pitfalls of try to understand a piece of legislation. [How to Decipher State Legislation Like a Proper Gentleman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuW3v4Ywr_M)

# Section by Section Summary

## Section 1\.

>Subchapter E, Chapter 452, Transportation Code, is amended by adding Section 452.204 to read as follows:  
	**Sec. 452.204.  GENERAL MOBILITY PROGRAM. (a) Each municipality in an authority consisting of one subregion governed by a subregional board created under Subchapter O shall enter into an agreement with the subregional board under which up to 25 percent of the sales and use tax imposed by the authority in that municipality may be used by that municipality for a general mobility program that includes:  
		(1)  constructing and maintaining sidewalks, hiking trails, and biking trails, highways and local and arterial streets, thoroughfares, and other roads, including bridges and grade separations;  
		(2)  installing, operating, and maintaining streetlights and traffic control improvements, including traffic signals; or  
		(3)  making drainage improvements and taking drainage-related measures as reasonable and necessary for the effective use of the transportation facility being installed, constructed, operated, or maintained under Subdivision (1) or (2).  
			(b)  Under an agreement entered into under Subsection (a), a municipality shall annually provide to the subregional board a list of projects the municipality intends to fund through the program.  
			(c)  Of the sales and use tax available to a municipality through the general mobility program each year:  
				(1)  50 percent shall be made available to the municipality on the first day of the authority's fiscal year; and  
				(2)  50 percent shall be made available to the municipality on a reimbursement basis before the end of the authority's fiscal year.  
			(d)  Any money made available to a municipality under Subsection (c) that is unused by the municipality in the period described by that subsection must be used by the authority to pay down any outstanding debt that is secured by a sales and use tax rate imposed at a rate of one percent.  A payment made under this subsection is in addition to any annual debt payment required of the authority.

Alright what the heck does all of that mean? Basically it creates a new section  452.204 that establishes a “General Mobility Program” for each member city

* Diverts 25% of sales tax revenue for Subchapter O Transit authorities (DART is the only Subchapter O authority in the state)  
* Can only be used for Roads, Traffic Signals, Sidewalks, or drainage projects i.e Not transit  
* Half made available at the beginning of the FY, Half available on a reimbursement basis  
* The city must submit a list of project they plan to use the funds for each year  
* Unused funds go into a trust for additional debt payments on top of regularly scheduled bond payments \[reword\]

## Section 2\.

>Section 452.357(a), Transportation Code, is amended to read as follows:  
	(a)  To secure the payment of an authority's bonds, the authority may:  
		(1)  pledge **not more than 75 percent** \[~~all or part~~\] of revenue realized from any tax that the authority may impose;  
		(2)  pledge any part of the revenue of the public transportation system;  
		(3)  mortgage any part of the public transportation system, including any part of the system subsequently acquired;  
		(4)  pledge all or part of funds the federal government  
 	has committed to the authority as grants in aid; and  
		(5)  provide that a pledge of revenue described by Subdivision (1) or (2) is a first lien or charge against that revenue.

Amends Section 452.357(a) to change the amount of revenue that can be pledged towards bond from “all or part” to “not more than 75 percent”

## Section 3

>Section 452.358, Transportation Code, is amended to read as follows: 
>	Sec. 452.358.  USE OF REVENUE.  Revenue in excess of amounts  
 	pledged under Section 452.357(a)(1) or (2) shall be used to:  
	 	(1)  pay the expenses of operation and maintenance of a  
 	public transportation system, including salaries, labor,  
 	materials, and repairs necessary to provide efficient service and  
 	every other proper item of expense; \[~~and~~\]  
	 	(2)  fund operating reserves; and  
		**(3)  fund a general mobility program established under  
 	Section 452.204.**

This section simply adds the GENERAL MOBILITY PROGRAM as an allowed used of 452 sales tax funds, and importantly makes the Mobility program a lower priority than bond payments.

## Section 4\. 

>Section 452.401(a), Transportation Code, is  
 	amended to read as follows:  
 	(a)  The executive committee may impose for an authority a  sales and use tax at the rate of:  
	 	(1)  one-quarter of one percent;  
 	    (2)  one-half of one percent; or  
 	    (3)  three-quarters of one percent\[~~; or 
 	    \[(4)  one percent~~\].

This section amends Section 452.491(a) to remove “one percent” as an allowed sales and use tax rate. On its face this make look like blowing up DARTs bond convents, remember this for when we get to section 8. 

## Section 5\.
>Section 452.651(c),   Transportation Code, is  
 	amended to read as follows:    
 	       (c)  An election to withdraw may not be ordered, and a  
 	petition for an election to withdraw may not be accepted for filing,  
 	more frequently than once during each period of 12 months preceding  
 	the anniversary of the date of the election confirming the  
 	authority.  If the unit of election is located in an authority  
 	consisting of one subregion governed by a subregional board created  
 	under Subchapter O, an election for withdrawal of the unit of  
 	election under this section may not be ordered, and a petition for  
 	withdrawal may not be accepted, more frequently than once during  
 	1996 and during each **third** \[~~sixth~~\] calendar year after that year.

Changes the frequency of withdrawal election from being allowed every sixth year to every third year

## Section 6\.
>Subchapter Q, Chapter 452, Transportation Code,  
 	is amended by adding Section 452.6545 to read as follows:  
 	       Sec. 452.6545.  EFFECT OF NOTICE OF ELECTION ON CERTAIN  
 	AUTHORITY TO ISSUE OBLIGATIONS. Notwithstanding Subchapter H, on  
 	receipt by the executive committee of the authority of a notice  
 	provided under Section 452.655(c), the authority may not issue  
 	notes, bonds, or other obligations if the issuance would cause the  
 	financial obligation of the unit of election under Section  
 	452.659(a) to accrue because the amount in Section 452.659(b)(3)  
 	would increase.  This limitation on issuance continues until:  
 	             (1)  the effective date of the withdrawal of the unit of  
 	election from the authority, if after an election held under  
 	Section 452.655 less than a majority of the votes received on the  
 	measure in the election favor the proposition; or   
 	             (2)  the day after the date of the canvass of an  
 	election held under Section 452.655, if a majority of the votes  
 	received on the measure in the election favor the proposition.

This section adds a new section that prohibits the issuance of new debt that would cause the financial obligation of a withdrawing city to increase while a withdrawal election is pending

## Section 7

>Section 452.658(a), Transportation Code, is  
 	amended to read as follows:      
 	       (a)  Until the amount of revenue from an authority's sales  
 	and use tax collected in a withdrawn unit of election after the  
 	effective date of withdrawal and paid to the authority equals the  
 	total financial obligation of the unit, the sales and use tax  
 	continues to be collected in the territory of the election unit **at  
 	the rate:  
	 	(1)  at which the tax was imposed; or  
	 	(2)  of one-half of one percent if:  
		 	(A)  the tax was imposed at the rate of one  
 	percent; and
		 	(B)  the governing body of the withdrawn unit of  
 	election approves the collection of the tax at the lower rate.***
 	
This Section allows the city council of a withdrawn city to lower the tax rate to one-half of one percent. On its face this would violate DARTs current bond covenants, but this bill has some mitigations in the next section.

## Section 8
>Sections 452.357(a) and 452.401(a),  
 	Transportation Code, as amended by this Act, do not apply to the  
 	imposition of a sales and use tax in a regional transportation  
 	authority that, before the effective date of this Act, has pledged  
 	the revenue from the tax imposed at the rate of one percent as  
 	security for bonds issued by the authority.  The imposition of a  
 	sales and use tax in a regional transportation authority that has  
 	pledged the revenue from the tax imposed at the rate of one percent  
 	as security for bonds issued by the authority before the effective  
 	date of this Act is governed by the law in effect when the revenue  
 	was pledged, and that law is continued in effect for that purpose.  
 	       (b)  The executive committee of a regional transportation  
 	authority may, under Section 452.405, Transportation Code, order  
 	the decrease in the rate at which a sales and use tax is collected in  
 	an authority described by Subsection (a) of this section only  
 	after:  
 	             (1)  all of the bonds and interest on the bonds that are  
 	payable from or secured by a sales and use tax imposed at the rate of  
 	one percent have been paid by the issuer of the bonds or another  
 	person with the consent or approval of the issuer; or  
 	             (2)  a sufficient amount for the payment of all bonds  
 	and interest on the bonds to maturity has been set aside by the  
 	issuer of the bonds or another person with the consent or approval  
 	of the issuer in a trust fund held for the benefit of the  
 	bondholders.

Alright this is the really complicated one. This section is all about not violating DARTs current debt covenants and destroying the state's bond rating. It's broken into two subsections a and b.

Subsection a basically says that the amendments to sections 452.357(a) and 452.401(a) do not apply to bonds that 1\) have already been issued before the effective date of the bill and 2\) have the full one percent sales tax pledged to them.

Subsection b says the agency can reduce its tax rate if 1\) all of the bonds pledged at one percent have been paid off OR 2\) enough money to pay off the remaining balance is saved in a trust account (remember those unused General Mobility funds? This is where those go)


## Analysis

In my view this bill has 3 goals:

1. Give 25% back to the member cities immediately to be used for road maintenance
2. Impose restricts so that DARTs tax rate will eventually be reduced to .75%
3. Make it easier to withdraw from DART, and make that withdrawal less painful   

Now it's also important to remember what this bill does not do, it does not lower taxes. Any reduction in DARTs tax rate will not go into the pockets of taxpayers, cities will immediately move to increase their sales tax rate if the rate is reduced to .75%. This bill is about changing who gets the money, and Plano wants to take over 40% of DARTs funding.

This bill is about Plano raiding DART for money to pay for their road and street maintenance. They told us as much in their [Mayor’s letter to the Chair of the DART board last year](https://dallasareatransitalliance.org/assets/blog/data-statement-plano-ila/jbm-to-gary-slagel-dart-12-13-2024.pdf). Notably Plano is proposing to issue over $400 million road maintenance bonds over the next 4 years, while at the same time having adopted the “no new revenue” property tax rate for the last 4 years in a row. If Plano needs more money to pay for their roads they have a mechanism to do that without tearing apart DART, they either raise their property taxes modestly, or if they want the sales tax dollars they can call an election to withdraw from the agency.  

Importantly this bill alters what ALL member cities revenues can be used for, the 25% for the General Mobility fund CAN NOT be used to fund transit operation, even if the member city wants to, and this restriction persists beyond when DARTs current 1% pledged bonds are extinguished. In 1983 voters in every DART member city decided to dedicate a 1% sales to build a public transit system for the entire region, they reaffirmed that vision in 2000 by authorizing DART to issue you long term bonds for the construction and maintenance of its Light Rail system, the 2nd largest such system in the state. To have the state come in and decimate DARTs ability to operate the system we have investing Billions of dollars to build would be fiscally irresponsible.

It's hard to overstate how bad this bill is. What organization can you think of that can lose almost 40% of its funding (or even just 20%) and provide anywhere near the same level of service? and to try and do this on the eve of the suburban focused Silver Line opening? It's unconscionable, many member cities have been quite patient in waiting for their turn to get rail service, this bill will cripple that service as well as all of DARTs other existing services.


# Call to action

Alright so what do we do now?

We need you to contact your representatives. Call or Email them and let them know you Oppose House Bill 3187. Let them know that you don't want DARTs funding reduced by 44%  and that this is a local issue that Plano and DART need to work out among themselves.

DATA will be monitoring this bill very closely as it works its way through the legislative process.
