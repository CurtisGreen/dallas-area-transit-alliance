Join in in our next General Meeting. 

- Saturday, October 19, 2024 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM
- J. Erik Jonsson Central Library (5th Floor - Hamon Training Room)
- 1515 Young Street, Dallas, TX 75201 US

We will be discussing more plans about our state legislative strategy, giving some advocacy updates, and socializing with our fellow transit advocates as we always do.

We have special speakers planned too. House Representative 112 Candidate Averie Bishop and Senate District 12 Candidate Stephanie Draper will be joining us! Our attendance has been consistently in the 50-60 range, which is incredible. Staying active and engaged is how we will win this fight!

After the meeting, we will be going to the dining Hall at the AT&T Discovery District, feel free to join us!

## We do NOT want legislative action that would effectively reduce DART's sales tax funding.

Once again, thanks for your continued support, especially at the most recent board meeting with over 17 DATA members speaking and many more attending or watching from home. We hope to see you at another DATA event or at a board meeting.
