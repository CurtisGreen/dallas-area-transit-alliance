## Week without Driving (Monday, September 29 – Sunday, October 5, 2025)

## About the National Campaign

Nearly a third of people living in the United States – people with disabilities, young people, seniors and people who can’t afford cars or gas- do not drive. Disability Rights Washington created the Week Without Driving challenge in 2021 so that policy makers, elected leaders, and transportation professionals can begin to understand the barriers nondrivers experience in accessing our communities. After two successful years of hosting the challenge in Washington State, #WeekWithoutDriving went national in 2023 in partnership with America Walks.


## Why Host This In Dallas?

Dallas is a city built for cars, where it is difficult or dangerous to travel almost anywhere unless you are in a vehicle. Individual movements are popping up across Dallas that intersect with the need for a walkable city. For example, the Dallas Bike Coalition is focusing on safe streets for cyclists. Better Block, through the work of placemaking, transforms spaces into places where people can gather and build community. Other groups are focused on housing, climate, and social justice that all contribute to this idea that cities should be built for people, not cars. #WeekWithoutDrivingDallas will bring these groups together to highlight for a local audience and elected officials the urgent need to create a city that serves all of Dallas residents, not just those with the ability to drive and afford a car.

## How do I participate?

1. Sign up on the [national site](https://go.ridewithdata.org/wwd-signup). Select elected official, transportation official, individual, or your appropriate role.
2. Replace as many car trips as possible with walking, transit, or biking. One trip or one day is a success. A perfect week is not the goal!
3. Check out our partner organizations below and follow along with the work they are doing to invest in transportation choices, safe streets, and efficient public transportation.
4. Reflect on the experience using the [Week Without Driving Reflection Questions](https://go.ridewithdata.org/wwd-reflection). Share your thoughts with us and our partners on social media too!
