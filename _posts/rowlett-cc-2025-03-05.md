FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**Dallas Area Transit Alliance Applauds Rowlett City Council’s Support for Full DART Funding**  

ROWLETT, TX — Tonight, the Rowlett City Council adopted a resolution to rescind Resolution 044-24, which supported a cut of the DART sales tax by 25%, and instead support “the full funding of the Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) system and urges local, regional, and state
governments to prioritize continued investment in public transit, particularly DART, to ensure its long-term viability and success.”

The Dallas Area Transit Alliance (DATA) applauds the City of Rowlett for this strong show of support for DART. We are grateful to the city councilmembers for their willingness to reconsider their prior resolution after outreach from DART and DART-riding citizens of Rowlett, and we hope that the other cities that adopted similar resolutions last year follow Rowlett’s lead. As we face the prospect of catastrophic cuts to DART through anti-DART legislation in the form of HB3187 and SB1557, it is critical that the DART member cities work together with DART to build a better, brighter transit system for the benefit of the whole service area.
