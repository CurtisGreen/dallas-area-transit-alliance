FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**Dallas Area Transit Alliance statement on House Bill 3187 and Senate Bill 1557**  

DALLAS, TEXAS — The Dallas Area Transit Alliance stands firmly opposed to any legislation that cuts DART’s funding. HB3187 and SB1557 would immediately slash DART’s funding by 25%, and force DART to eventually reduce the amount of sales tax it can collect by another 25%. These cuts would deal irreparable harm to the transportation infrastructure of North Texas. The ultimate goal of HB3187 and SB1557 is to dismantle public transportation across all 13 of the DART member cities, at the behest of Plano. The vast majority of people served by DART do not support this effort. DART deserves the full funding its voters agreed to and DART’s funding must not be used as a slush fund to cover for mismanagement of city budgets. It is not in the state's, region’s, or voters' best interest to smash and loot our greatest economic and transportation asset.
