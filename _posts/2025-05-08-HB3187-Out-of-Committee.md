House Bill 3187 has been voted out of committee.

This bill will ultimately lead to the end of DART. Their capital plan will get axed, because even though their budget is cut by 25% their debt service isn't.

The service cuts will be severe, the immediate impact will be thousands of transit dependents losing their jobs or spending an extra 30-60 minutes commuting, as wait times will significantly increase and reliability will tank.
DART will be unable to maintain their assets. They will lose federal funding, they will lose fare revenue, and go into a death spiral

This bill really truly means the end of DART. It's unlikely they will be able to maintain any political support. All the infrastructure we invested will go to waste, and ultimately the agency will die. Even if DART does survive, the service will be unrecognizable.

We implore all of you reading this comment to please [contact your state representatives](go.ridewithdata.org/wrm) at your earliest convenience.
