August has been a busy month with budget season for all the cities, so here's what's upcoming in September!

Thanks everyone for coming out last week and speaking to the DART Board and Dallas City Council, your message was certainly heard from the media and various council members.

## Do you know a Rowlett Resident or Business Owner?

Let's try to get some DART positivity headed to Rowlett's way before the city council meeting on Tuesday.

Nadine Lee will be showing up to speak to Rowlett City Council on Tuesday, September 3rd at 7:00pm.

If you know any residents or business owners who would be opposed to DART cuts. Please have them go speak at either at the public meeting itself or just before it through email.

- [Public Comment Request - Rowlett](https://www.rowletttx.gov/FormCenter/Public-Input-11-11/Public-Input-118-118)

Once again, thanks for your continued support. We hope to see you at another DATA event or at a board meeting.
