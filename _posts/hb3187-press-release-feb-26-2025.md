FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**Dallas Area Transit Alliance statement on House Bill 3187 and Senate Bill 1557**  

DALLAS, TEXAS — > The Dallas Area Transit Alliance stands firmly opposed to any legislation that targets DART’s funding. The ultimate goal of HB3187 and SB1557 is clearly to dismantle public transportation across all 13 of the DART member cities, at the behest of Plano and Irving. The vast majority of people served by DART do not support this effort. DART’s riders deserve the full funding their voters agreed to and DART’s funding must not be used as a slush fund to cover for mismanagement of budgets by local governments. It is not in the state nor region’s best interest to smash and loot our greatest economic and transportation asset.
