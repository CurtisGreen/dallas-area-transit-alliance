The DART board is discussing cutting back fixed route bus service in Plano in order to fund city wide GoLink service. This is a bad idea. First, this would exclude the most vulnerable people in their community. GoLink does not operate well without an Internet connected smart phone. Of course, the most vulnerable are the least likely to have one, for example, older people, disabled people, and poor people.

Additionally, as GoLink service requires one driver for every few passengers instead of one driver serving many passengers, the cost scales dramatically faster for GoLink than for bus service. Therefore, replacing fixed route service with GoLink service would dramatically increase the cost just to service the existing riders. On top of this, a single GoLink zone is going to attract new riders, further increasing the cost. This is not a fiscally sound decision.

Further, the board contemplated reducing rail frequency to help fund a single GoLink zone. This is an unacceptable compromise. Rail service is so critical for riders getting into and out of Plano. It is so well used that DART is already looking into increasing the rail service frequency. 

While we do not oppose a single Plano GoLink zone, it is not prudent for this to come at the expense of bus and rail service.
