This February Newsletter is going to be a little somber, please read this email while sitting down.

On January 24, 2025, our Executive Committee was notified that Mary Collier, our Events Planning Committee Chair, passed away on Tuesday, January 21, 2025. 

Mary was a fierce warrior for public transportation while also planning so many social gatherings that brought this community together, her work shines across many organizations and groups. Mary’s efforts laid the foundation for much of what DATA stands for today, inspiring countless individuals to take action.

Mary started her work in DATA with organizing our founding event caused by city council member remarks and organizing a trash cleanup in Farmers Branch, Texas. Mary exemplified how to get to work and make a difference in the community. 

<!-- ![Image](/assets/blog/remembering-mary/FB-Trash-Cleanup-2024) -->

Mary continued her advovacy by speaking at City Council meetings (namely in Carrollton, Plano, and the City of Dallas) and DART Board meetings to advocate for continued DART funding (No Caps, No Cuts), Bus Procurement, and Bus Frequency Improvements.

<!--
Make a private Google Drive/ unlisted Youtube with all of Mary's remarks, pull from Hexel Mary's comment at DART Board meeting posted on DUSTLC Instagram (done),  does not need to be done right now
-->

In September, after planning many unofficial DATA events, Mary put in her canidacy for the Event Planning Coordinator Chair, Mary won the vote and started planning all events for DATA and other partner organizations like DFW Urbanistas and Comet's for Better Transit (CfBT is a DART advovacy group for UT Dallas Students)

Some of the many events she planned were across many organizations and in many cities.
<!-- Add list or summary of all events, we may have a very long list, does not need to be done right now--> 
- Canvassing and Tabling Events in Carrollton, Dallas, Farmers Branch, Irving, Plano, Richardson and Rowlett
- DATA General Meetings
- City of Dallas speaking engagements
- City of Plano speaking engagements
- DART Board and Committee of the Whole speaking engagements
- Week without Driving in 2024 with DFW Urbanistas, Better Block, and Dallas Bicycle Coalition
- Downtown Series (Explore and Canvass in various cities)
- DFW Urbanistas events in Carrollton
- Happy Hour and Social Events
- Volunteering with DART at the Dallas Holiday Parade 2024

Mary had planned several events in the [calendar](/calendar), and we realize that may raise some important questions. The Executive Committee has decided that out of respect for her and all the work she put into DATA, these events will not be canceled. It is our belief that she would have wanted us to keep the community together and continue our efforts to save DART, so that is exactly what we will be doing.
