## Myth: DART's sales tax cut won't impact service.

**Fact**: DART's Chief Communications Officer, Jeamy Molina, has clearly stated that any cut to DART's sales tax could result in reduced services, staff layoffs, and a significant funding loss of nearly **$6 billion** over the next 20 years. Furthermore, the North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG) does not call for cutting DART sales tax in its Transit 2.0 Request For Proposal (RFP), a study requested by DART's member cities into improving transit for the next 40 years. Instead, it stated:  
> "Currently there is no evidence that a lower tax rate at DART is possible. If it is possible, what are the impacts to **service, debt obligations and future service commitments**."

Without careful consideration, these cuts could jeopardize critical projects like the Silver Line or the Tier 2 Bus Network.

## Myth: DART is not expanding its services.

**Fact**: DART's phase 2 (also known as tier 2) bus network is giving all member cities a massive boost in bus service, especially on the highest performing routes. This includes many over-performing suburban bus routes that DART is rewarding with extra frequent service. The phase 2 bus network gives the average DART resident access to 30% more jobs within an hour commute. DART has started implementing their new bus network this year with new bus routes in Irving and Plano, and with frequency boosts on the light rail.

## Myth: DART's ridership is declining.

**Fact**: While the pandemic caused a temporary decline, DART's ridership has been recovering rapidly. The notion that ridership is continuously declining is misleading; recent trends show significant growth.

## Myth: DART is not addressing cleanliness and security.

**Fact**: DART has upgraded all bus and light rail seats to vinyl for easier cleaning and has enhanced security by hiring additional officers and improving response times. Upgraded CCTV systems further bolster safety measures.

## Myth: DART is not investing in rider amenities.

**Fact**: DART is modernizing its infrastructure with new Next Generation Bus Shelters designed by University of Texas at Arlington students with a focus on safety, climate control, adaptability, and enhanced rider experience. These shelters will also feature Real Time Displays for bus arrival information.

## Myth: DART is not contributing to local development.

**Fact**: DART's FY2025 strategic vision includes assisting 11 transit-oriented development (TOD) projects in multiple cities.

A dedicated Real Estate & Economic Development Department was established to support these initiatives.

### Bottom Line

DART is proactively addressing customer concerns, expanding services, and improving overall transit quality. Cutting DART's funding would undermine these efforts, despite growth in ridership and clear evidence of progress. DART's continuous improvement and strategic vision showcase a commitment to enhancing transit for the community, making any funding cuts counterproductive.
