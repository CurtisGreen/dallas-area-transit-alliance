FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**DATA Response to DART Board of Directors Workshop on Member City Requests and Demands**  

DALLAS, TEXAS – On December 18, 2024, the DART Board of Directors held a workshop to discuss [several key requests and demands raised by its member cities](/assets/blog/2024-12-20-data-statement-plano-ila/jbm-to-gary-slagel-dart-12-13-2024.pdf), primarily Plano. The discussion focused on four primary topics:

1. Provide a sum of dollars equal to 25% of both Plano’s 2024 and 2025 sales tax through a Interlocal Agreement (ILA)
2. Provide a city-wide, single-zone GoLink service
3. Provide a circulator service connecting the commercial and business centers at Legacy
4. Delay the upcoming bus replacement purchase

Some of the member cities’ proposals offer promising opportunities for improvement. For instance, increased communication between DART and its member cities is a constructive step forward. Additionally, initiatives to streamline the development process on DART-owned land, without additional spending, align well with regional transit goals.

However, not all requests are reasonable. Plano's demand to reclaim 25% of its sales tax contributions is fundamentally flawed. DART is not a financial reserve for cities to withdraw funds for non-transit-related projects. Using transit-dedicated funds for road projects undermines the agency's core mission and would significantly impact bus and rail services across the entire system.

Plano’s proposal for a citywide GoLink service is equally problematic. Such a program would divert funds from fixed-route services, making it more challenging to maintain the comprehensive transit network. GoLink services are also expensive, difficult to scale, and exclude those who lack access to necessary technology. For a city council that emphasizes fiscal conservatism, prioritizing the most expensive option seems contradictory.

Moreover, Plano’s request to alter DART’s recently passed bus procurement plan contradicts the will of the majority of the member cities. The procurement plan, approved by the DART Board, ensures timely replacement of aging buses to maintain service reliability. Changing course now would delay bus replacements, disrupt transit service across the region, and compromise the system’s health—including in Plano. Unlike typical purchases, procuring buses takes 18 months to two years, making any delay a major setback.

Regarding governance, several proposed changes warrant further exploration. However, a sales-tax-based board representation model or weighted voting system raises concerns about transparency and equity. While governance reform is important, it must prioritize clarity and fairness to ensure public trust and understanding.

The Dallas Area Transit Alliance (DATA) urges the DART Board to carefully evaluate these proposals with a focus on equity, sustainability, and the agency's mission to serve transit riders across the region.
