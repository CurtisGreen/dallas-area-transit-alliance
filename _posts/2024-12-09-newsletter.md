Happy Holidays from all of us at DATA! We got a few events and some news for this month we'd like for you to be aware about

**Join us this Tuesday, December 10**, at the DART Board Meeting to advocate for the procurement of new buses. Your stories and support can make a real difference!

## Key details to keep in mind:

- **Agenda Item:** Use Agenda Item 17 on your comment card when speaking.
- **Why it matters:** Share your experiences with bus breakdowns and why new buses are crucial for reliable service.
If you cannot attend in person, please email your DART board member to express your support for this critical initiative. DART faces challenges in securing new debt, but these buses are vital to maintaining and improving the services we all depend on.

## Why act now?

- **The World Cup 2026:** Dallas will host international visitors, and reliable buses are essential for transporting people to events. Let’s ensure DART is ready to shine on the world stage!
- **Aging fleet:** Many buses are old and overdue for replacement. Delays mean higher repair costs and reduced service reliability.
**Your voice matters:** Does DART get you to work, the grocery store, or essential appointments? Let the board know how these services impact your life!
Find the email for you DART board member here: [DART Board Members Emails](https://dallasareatransitalliance.org/posts/fy25-dart-budget-proposal-response#:~:text=DART%20board%20contact%20list%3A)

Let’s come together to ensure our transit system meets the needs of our growing community.

## Upcoming Events

This month, instead of our regular general meetings, we’re excited to host two social events! These events are a chance to connect, celebrate, and socialize with fellow DATA members while supporting our shared passion for better transit.


## 1st Annual Holiday Social
