### Plano City Council (For those who live or work in Plano)
Tell Plano City Council to tell the DART Board to implement the citywide GoLink without removing bus service. Plano can have their city wide and keep their buses too

The meeting starts at 7pm however public comments are taken via Zoom and after the end of the regular city council meeting

### DART Board Meeting (For ALL Members)
We will be showing up to the DART Board meeting to tell the DART Board to implement the citywide GoLink without removing bus service. Plano can have their city wide and keep their buses too.

**Event Details**

- Tuesday, February 25 from 5:45PM to 10:00PM
- DART Headquarters at 1401 Pacific Ave, Dallas
- Nearest Rail Station: Akard Station (Red, Orange, Blue, & Green)
- [RSVP on the Action Network](https://actionnetwork.org/events/february-general-meeting-and-special-election)

## Plano's Bus Service is Under Attack
**Background:** Plano requested a citywide GoLink zone and proposed removing bus routes so resources used on fixed routes could be allocated to GoLink instead.

**DART Analysis:** Staff analyzed the request without endorsing or opposing it, focusing solely on logistics. There are really two main ways they can go about this:

### Establish a city wide GoLink zone without removing any bus routes
- Estimated Cost: $4.5M-$10.8M per year (cost is dependent on how many riders switch from buses to GoLink, most won't)
### Remove the Plano portions of Routes 236 and 247, and completely replace the 254 and 234 with city wide GoLink
- Leaves Plano with only 3 bus routes
- Routes 308, 241, and 239 would remain untouched
- Estimated cost: $11M-$13.1M, including a $5.1M in savings from route removals  

Our thoughts: While it seems counterintuitive, removing the Plano bus routes is the most difficult and expensive option for DART. This is because every trip being made on the routes 236, 234, 254, and 247 in Plano would need to be made on GoLink instead, which is far less efficient.

**Actions:** Tell Plano City Council and the DART board to implement the citywide GoLink without removing bus service. Plano can have their city wide and keep their buses too. Truly, the best of both worlds option.

**In summary,** keeping the Plano bus routes is better, cheaper, and more efficient.

## Remembering Mary
Last Sunday, DATA held a memorial ride in honor of the passing of our Event Planning Chair, Mary Collier. Mary was a fierce warrior for public transportation while also planning so many social gatherings that brought this community together. Many of the events planned by DATA were planned by her. Many DATA members and members of other organizations across the Dallas Urbanist community joined us on a memorial ride to Mary's workplace.

- Enrique MacGregor, DART Board of Director gave a wonderful tribute at the [DART Committee of the Whole Meeting on February 11](). As did Hexel Colorado, founder of Dallas Urbanists at the [Transit Tangents podcast recording](). Our executive committee also made [a post on our website](/posts/remembering-mary) of all the accomplishments Mary has done for DATA, DART, and Dallas a a whole.
